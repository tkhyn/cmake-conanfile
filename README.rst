cmake-conanfile
###############

A CMake wrapper for `Conan 2 <https://conan.io/>`_. Allows installing, configuring and
running Conan 2 from CMake.


What it does
============

The main purpose of ``cmake-conanfile`` is to configure and pass options to Conan 2 from CMake,
which is not possible with the `official CMake dependency provider <https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan/>`_.

To make the integration even smoother, ``cmake-conanfile`` can work without Conan being installed
on the system at all. If Conan is not found on the system (or if the installed Conan does not
match a minimum version), it can:

- create a dedicated Python virtual environment
- install Conan in this virtual environment
- set the ``CONAN_HOME`` environment variable to a project-specific folder so that dependencies can
  be shared between builds
- and run the Conan executable from the virtual environment

By default, the virtual environment and the local conan home folder will be located in the
``${CMAKE_PROJECT_DIR}/.conan`` directory. If this ends up being the case, you will probably want
to ignore this folder in your version control software. This directory can be customised using the
``CONANFILE_LOCAL_CONAN_HOME`` variable.

Requirements
============

``cmake-conanfile`` requires the following software to be present on the host machine:

- obviously, a compatible version of `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (â‰¥ 3.20), and
- either:

  - a version of Conan that satisfies the conan version requirements (if any), or
  - a recent version of `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>`_, which will be used to create the
    virtual environment. If neither ``python3`` nor ``python`` are in the ``PATH`` or if you need
    to use a specific Python binary, this can be done using the ``CONANFILE_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE``
    setup variable (see below)

Installation
============

Download the `conanfile.cmake <conanfile.cmake>`_ file and add it to your project in a place where
it can be found by CMake's ``include()`` command (you most likely already have a custom modules
directory), and simply use:

.. code-block:: cmake

   include(conanfile)

Alternatively, the file can be downloaded directly from this repository using the following code:

.. code-block:: cmake

   # Download conanfile.cmake if needed
   set(CMAKE_CONANFILE_VERSION 0.1a NO_CACHE)
   set(CMAKE_CONANFILE_PATH "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/conanfile_${CMAKE_CONANFILE_VERSION}.cmake")
   if(NOT EXISTS "${CMAKE_CONANFILE_PATH}")
     message(STATUS "Downloading conanfile.cmake from https://github.com/tkhyn/cmake-conanfile")
     file(
       DOWNLOAD
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkhyn/cmake-conanfile/${CMAKE_CONANFILE_VERSION}/conanfile.cmake"
       "${CMAKE_CONANFILE_PATH}"
       TLS_VERIFY ON
     )
   endif()
   include("${CMAKE_CONANFILE_PATH}")


Setup
=====

The behaviour of ``cmake-conanfile`` can be customised using optional cmake variables, that must be
defined before the call to ``include(conanfile)``.

CONANFILE_CONAN
   Can be ``LOCAL``, ``AUTO`` (default) or ``SYSTEM``:

   - If set to ``LOCAL``, ``cmake-conanfile`` will not consider any system-wide Conan installation
     and install a local conan and local conan packages (re-used for all builds, but not shared
     with other projects in the system)
   - If set to ``AUTO``, ``cmake-conanfile`` will try to find a system-wide Conan installation
     and will use it if it satisfies the version requirements. If not, it will install a local
     conan and local packages as if ``LOCAL`` was selected.
   - If set to ``SYSTEM``, ``cmake-conanfile`` will try to find a system-wide Conan installation
     and throw an error if it can't or if the installed version doesn't match the version
     requirements.

CONANFILE_CONAN_VERSION = ~=2.0
   The version requirement of Conan, `pip-style <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/>`_.
   Combined with ``CONANFILE_CONAN`` to determine if a local conan needs to be installed.

CONANFILE_LOCAL_CONAN_HOME
   The path to the directory that will contain the virtual environment and the local conan home,
   if a local conan gets installed (which depends on ``CONANFILE_CONAN_VERSION`` and
   ``CONANFILE_CONAN``). All invocations to the main `conanfile()` function within the
   scope of the CMake project will use the same virtual environment, conan version and conan home
   folder. Defaults to ``${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/.conan``.

.. warning::
   If multiple OSes use the same working tree (for example building from WSL on Windows),
   `CONANFILE_LOCAL_CONAN_HOME` should be OS-dependent, as the conan configuration and virtual
   environments cannot be shared. You may for example have:

   ```cmake
   set(CONANFILE_LOCAL_CONAN_HOME "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/.conan/${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}")
   ```

CONANFILE_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE
   Defines the python executable to use to create the virtual environment. Generally passed as a
   cmake command line option such as ``cmake -DCONANFILE_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3``


Usage
=====

Once the module has been loaded, the only interface is the ``conanfile()`` function.

This function will invoke ``conan`` against a specified conan file (by default it will be
``./conanfile.py``).

.. code-block:: cmake

   # Run conan against conanfile.py
   conanfile()

   # Run conan against conanfile_alt.py
   conanfile(CONANFILE conanfile_alt.py)

If some `OPTIONS` are passed, and if a `CMAKE_OPTIONS` dictionary has been initialised in
`conanfile.py` as below, then the options are forwarded to `conanfile.py`, which allows for
example installing optional dependencies only if specific conditions or internal CMake options
are set.

.. code-block:: cmake

   # Run conan against conanfile.py, with options
   set(MY_CONANFILE_OPTIONS "ENABLE_MY_OPTION=True")
   conanfile(OPTIONS ${MY_CONANFILE_OPTIONS})

.. code-block:: python

   from conan import ConanFile

   CMAKE_OPTIONS = {
     "ENABLE_MY_OPTION": False
   }

   class MyConanFile(ConanFile):
     def requirements(self):
       if CMAKE_OPTIONS["ENABLE_MY_OPTION"]:
           self.requires("my_optional_depenceny/0.0.1@user/channel")

.. note::

   Note: This means that it is also possible to run standalone `conan` against that `conanfile.py`. The
   default options will then be used.

conanfile parameters
--------------------

CONANFILE
   The path to the conanfile to run, relative to the current list directory. Defaults to
   ``conanfile.py``

OPTIONS
   A list of options that will be forwarded to the conanfile.py
